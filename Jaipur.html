<div id="d5">THE PINK CITY</div>
<p id="p1">Planned by Vidyadhar Bhattacharya, Jaipur holds the distinction of being the first planned city of India.
  Renowned globally for its coloured gems, the capital city of<br><br> Rajasthan combines the allure of its ancient history with
  all the advantages of a metropolis.
  The bustling modern city is one of the three corners of the golden<br><br> triangle that includes Delhi, Agra and Jaipur.<p>
    <p id="p2">The story goes that in 1876, the Prince of Wales visited India on a tour. Since the colour pink was symbolic of
       hospitality, Maharaja Ram Singh of Jaipur painted the<br><br> entire city pink. The pink that colours the city makes for a
       marvellous spectacle to behold. Jaipur rises up majestically against the backdrop of the forts Nahargarh,<br><br> Jaigarh and
        Garh Ganesh Temple.</p>
      <p id="p2">  Jaipur traces back its origins to 1727 when it was established by Jai Singh II, the Raja of Amber.
         He shifted his capital from Amber to the new city because of the<br><br> rapidly-growing population and an increasing
         water scarcity. Architect Vidyadhar Bhattacharya used the established principles of Vastu Shastra to build the city.

      <p id="p5">Located deep within the walled city, the City Palace Complex was conceived and built by Maharaja <br><br>Sawai Jai Singh
         II, the founder of Jaipur. A beautiful fusion of Mughal and Rajput architecture, the<br><br> palace is still home to the last
         ruling royal family which lives in a private section of the palace.<br><br> Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II is credited with
         building most of the structures, but it was expanded upon<br><br> by later rulers as well. The City Palace Complex includes
         the Mubarak Mahal (the palace of reception) <br><br>and the Maharani’s Palace (the palace of the queen). Mubarak Mahal now
         houses the Maharaja Sawai<br><br> Man Singh II Museum and displays a vast and unique collection of royal costumes, delicate
         Pashmina <br><br>(Kashmiri) shawls, Benaras silk saris, and other dresses with Sanganeri prints and folk embroidery.
         The <br><br>clothes of Maharaja Sawai Madho Singh I are also on display.</p>

      <p id="p5">Now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Jantar Mantar in Jaipur is considered to be the largest of the five<br><br>
        astronomical observatories built by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, the founder of Jaipur. It contains <br><br>sixteen geometric
        devices, designed to measure time, track celestial bodies and observe the orbits of <br><br>the planets around the sun.
        It also houses the Interpretation Centre that helps the tourists to<br><br> understand about the working principles & chronolgy
        of the observatory.</p></img></td>

  <p id="p5">  Hawa Mahal, literally the Palace of Winds, was built in 1799 by the poet king Sawai Pratap Singh as a <br><br>summer
     retreat for him and his family. It also served as a place where the ladies of the royal household<br><br> could observe everyday life
      without being seen themselves. This unique five-storey structure is a blend <br><br>of Hindu and Islamic architecture, and the
       exterior, with its small latticed windows (called jharokhas)<br><br>, resembles the crown of Lord Krishna. The windows also serve
       as an air-conditioner of sorts, blowing<br><br> cool air throughout the palace, making it the perfect retreat during summers.
       Built from pink<br><br> sandstone, the Hawa Mahal is Jaipur’s iconic landmark and visitors can view its complete magnificence<br><br>
        from outside, from across the road. However, it is also possible to climb right up to the top for a<br><br> wonderful view from
         the windows. Today, the Mahal is maintained by the Archaeological Department<br><br> of the Government of Rajasthan and also
          houses an archaeological museum in the courtyard</p>

      <p id="p5">The building gets its name from The Victoria and Albert Museum in London, the inspiration for its<br><br> design.
        The exquisitely built Albert Hall is housed in the centre of Ram Niwas Garden. Sir Swinton<br><br> Jacob (who is also the
         mastermind behind many other palaces in Rajasthan) conceptualised and<br><br> designed it using styles from the Indo-Sarcenic
          architecture and the Prince of Wales laid the foundation<br><br> stone of the building in 1876. The museum displays a wide
           range of metal objects, wood crafts, carpets ,<br><br> stone and metal sculptures, arms and weapons, natural stones and ivory
           goods. It also houses a large<br><br> collection of miniatures from Bundi, Kota, Kishangarh, Udaipur and Jaipur schools of art.
